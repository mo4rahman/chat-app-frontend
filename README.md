# User Stories

Users will find themselves in the landing page. They will have the option to log in ( if they are existing members) or to sign in.

To log in, you enter your username and password

To sign up, you click on the link to sign up and enter in your credentials (email, username, password) and you will be created as a new user.

Once you are logged in, you will be able to see all the users who are cool enough to have the link to this chat app and start chatting with any of them. Chats are in real time, and so two users will be able to send chats to each other instantly.
